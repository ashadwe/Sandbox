## puppies.html
- on fourth click (so after puppies start spinning) create a button to make them stop spinning. (not repeatable)
- make the images be a random puppy 
    - make it so that only one puppy of each type can be present (maybe up the maximum amount of puppies allowed before hubris for this)
## misc
- konami code script
- optimizations/rewrite
- make the addImage function from puppies.html reusable with different images

# questions

## puppies.html
- why does my if-else statement that checks for the presence of stopButton need to use === rather than just = or == being sufficient
- are event listeners inefficient? is there any other way to make the hover   color change work that doesn't use them? maybe use 
  css to do it after the element is created?

## misc
- What is closure? example? excercise? why/when use it?
- how do symbols work and when to use them?
