# wants
- make the addImage function from puppies.html reusable with different images
## puppies.html
- on fourth click (so after puppies start spinning) create a button to make them stop spinning. (not repeatable)
- have a minimum amount of padding between puppy images and puppy button
- make the images be a random puppy 
    - make it so that only one puppy of each type can be present (maybe up the maximum amount of puppies allowed before hubris for this)

# issues

# questions

## puppies.html
- why does my if-else statement that checks for the presence of stopButton need to use === rather than just = being sufficient
- are event listeners inefficient? is there any other way to make the hover color change work that doesn't use them?
